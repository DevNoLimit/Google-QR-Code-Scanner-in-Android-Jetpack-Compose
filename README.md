<h3>What is Google code scanner</h3>
The Google code scanner API provides a complete solution for scanning code without requiring your app to request camera permission, while preserving user privacy. This is accomplished by delegating the task of scanning the code to Google Play services and returning only the scan results to your app (Video 1). All image processing occurs on the device and Google doesn't store the results or image data. The API supports the same code formats as the ML Kit Barcode Scanning API and returns the same Barcode object.
